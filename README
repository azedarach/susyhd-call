SUSYHDCall
==========

SUSYHDCall is a small add-on for FlexibleSUSY providing an
interface for calling the Mathematica package SUSYHD from
within C++ code.  The purpose of the library is to provide a
convenient means of using SUSYHD simultaneously with other
codes, without having to write additional glue code.  While
intended as an addon for FlexibleSUSY, the code can also be
compiled as a standalone library and linked to other spectrum
generators for convenient use in scans.

Requirements
============

 * C++ compiler (g++ >= 4.8.2 or clang++ >= 3.6)
 * Mathematica (version 7.0 or higher), with MathLink
   or WSTP developer kits
 * SUSYHD (version 1.0.2 or higher)   http://users.ictp.it/~susyhd/

Optional

 * FlexibleSUSY (version 1.0.4 or higher)   https://flexiblesusy.hepforge.org

Compiling the source code
=========================

To compile the library, first create the Makefile by running
configure,

   $ ./configure

or first run ./configure -h to view the possible options that can
be used.  Then compile,

   $ make

Optionally you may run some tests to ensure the compilation
succeeded by running

   $ make check

Installing as a FlexibleSUSY addon
==================================

To install the package as a FlexibleSUSY addon, provide the path to
the FlexibleSUSY addons directory during the configuration step,

   $ ./configure --with-fs-addons-dir=/path/to/FlexibleSUSY/addons

The addon can then be installed by running

   $ make install-addon

which creates the directory addons/susyhd_call and copies the source
code to that directory.  A Makefile module is also created in this
directory for building the addon.  To compile the addon, configure
FlexibleSUSY and run make,

   $ cd /path/to/FlexibleSUSY
   $ ./configure --with-addons=susyhd_call
   $ make

Note that it is not necessary to run the createaddon script; the
required Makefile modules are created in the install process.
